Summary
I am glad that I have participated in KWoc 2019 as a participant to learn and enhanced my existing coding skills. During the entire coding period, I was involved in the project and to contribute the patches in the open-source project and of course, the project mentor Mr. Aman Kumar help us to a lot. He has assigned the specific task to me and our members so that there should not be any confusion. And as a result, we finally made a website without any backend support but only frontend design. 
Thanks a lot to the KWoc and their members for providing us a platform where we can learn about open-source projects and prepared ourselves for GSoc.
